	<p>These rules and standards are described in this Agreement.

This means that if you, or anyone using your BizCube&reg; account (including anyone using any sub-account you may establish under your main account), violate the terms of this Agreement, BizCube Solutions Pte Ltd may take any and all appropriate actions—this can range from the issuance of a warning about a violation to the termination of your access privileges for BizCube&reg; to legal action—as BizCube Solutions Pte Ltd deems necessary or appropriate. BizCube Solutions Pte Ltd is not required to provide notice prior to terminating your BizCube&reg; access for violating these rules and standards, but it may choose to do so.
	
	<p>You are solely responsible for your conduct, and the conduct of anyone using your account or any sub-accounts, while using BizCube&reg;, including the contents of all email messages generated or forwarded, and all Content in any folders, home pages or other transmissions, information, images or other interactions generated, transmitted or maintained on or through your BizCube&reg; account or any sub-account.
